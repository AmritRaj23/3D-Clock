# 3D-Clock
The aim of the project was to model a 3D clock using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

If all files have been downloaded correctly and the html file is executed, the 3D clock should look as follows:-

The front side of the clock shows the current time in Hamburg, Germany. While, the back side shows the current time in New Delhi, India. As of now the programe does not take daylight savings into account. Hence, the time in New Delhi will be different if the programme is run from 29 March - 25 October. An update will be released that takes DST into account.

Please navigate left/right and up/down using the mouse while the left click is held. Zooming in/out can be achieved using the scroll wheel.
